This is a placeholder for the résumé PDF file.

In a real implementation, you would:
1. Create an actual PDF résumé using tools like Google Docs, Microsoft Word, or LaTeX
2. Save it as "resume.pdf" in the public directory
3. The download link on the résumé page will automatically serve this file

For now, this text file serves as a placeholder to demonstrate the file structure.
